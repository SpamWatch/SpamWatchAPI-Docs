# Permissions
Each endpoint (except `/version`) requires a cetain permission level. The required level is mentioned on the documentation of the endpoint.

The API has three permission levels:

Level | Rights
---------- | -------
Root | Can do everything
Admin | Can query and update the banlist
User | Can query the Banlist
