# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import spamwatch

client = spamwatch.Client('API_KEY')
```

```javascript
const SpamWatch = require('spamwatch');

const client = new SpamWatch.Client("API_KEY");
```

```crystal
require "spamwatch"

token = "API_KEY"
client = SpamWatch::Client.new(token)
```

```csharp
using SpamWatch;

var client = new SpamWatch.Client("API_KEY");
```

> Make sure to replace `APIgit st_KEY` with your API key.

The API uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get a API key in the [Support Chat](https://t.me/SpamWatchSupport).

The API expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key.
